About
======

I am a PhD candidate at the **[Visual Data Science Lab (V-DS)](http://www.visualdslab.com/)** at **[Fundação Getúlio Vargas (EMAp)](https://emap.fgv.br/)** in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, supervised by Prof. Jorge Poco with the CAPES Scholarship. 

My expertise is in machine learning, urban computing, large vision-language models, and explainable AI. My research interest lies in developing efficient and robust models for analyzing and understanding human perception from street images, as well as extracting key perceptual features for applications in urban computing.

*AI Data Scientist* <span style="float:right">May 2019 - May 2022</span>

* **LegalAnalytics**: _Exploring and predicting possible citations between Brazilian legal documents_. Analysis, processing, organization, and extraction of the content of legal documents from the Brazilian Supreme Court-STF. Through NLP and LLMs, it is possible to identify and predict the most relevant sentences. 
			
* **TimberFlow**: _Detection of deforestation and illegal transport in the Amazon_. Integration of Sinaflor and Sisflora, Brazil's two most relevant databases on timber transport. Through Markov chains and graph networks, it is possible to predict the most likely transport flow between a consumer and a producer. 
			
* **UrbVis**: _Analysis of criminal data and correlations with urban security perception_. Through convolutional networks, segmentation, and object detection, it is possible to identify, process and extract the main characteristics of street images in order to predict the perception of security in the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo.
