## Technological Research Projects

**BeaGons Project! Development of a convergent platform and library in Android for the development of applications of an ICT-based Smart City** ~ *April 2016 - December 2016*

Design development of a transversal ICT infrastructure, flexible and scalable that allows the mayor abstraction of data from both mobile devices and sensors. As for specific objectives: - Development of libraries in the Web Server. - Implementation of a concurrent and scalable database. - Recognition and sending / receiving data from the sensors to the server. Granted by the General Institute of Research (IGI) of UNI.

**Design tools and maintenance of urban transport flow systems using high performance computing and Big Data technologies** ~ *January 2016 - July 2017*

A flexible integration system for HPC (High Performance Computing) and Big Data solutions is proposed, providing the necessary tools to control and improve an urban transport infrastructure. The project is based on the static-dynamic duality of a transport model, for which it takes advantage of the flow and exchange of large amounts of information and communications, with which a proper simulation of urban transport will be carried out. Sponsored by FONDECYT.

**Design and implementation of a cluster with recycled PCs** ~ *February 2015 - August 2015*

This project presents the implementation of a cluster of Computers to equip CTIC UNI with a High Performance Computing Machine, using as a hardware base low cost personal computers and open source software such as LINUX. Also, the architecture of the machine cluster used for the implementation of the Beowulf cluster in CTIC is described. Finally, the evaluation of the implemented cluster is presented comparing it with machines of last generation.
