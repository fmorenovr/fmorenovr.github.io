## About

I'm a Post-Doctoral Fellow at Fundação Getúlio Vargas (FGV EMAp) working with Data Science techniques to build evidence-based tools to analyze the Amazon rainforest deforestation and degradation. I hold a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the Federal University of Minas Gerais were I worked mainly on machine learning topics applied to dynamical systems fault diagnosis and prognostics. I'm particularly interested in statistical and AI models that can extract knowledge from time-series recursively in a continuous learning scheme. I'm also a back-end developer very passionate about Python and DevOps with a B.Sc. in Systems Engineering. [[CV]](/pdf/CV.pdf)
