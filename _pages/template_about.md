I am a Research Assistant in the [Escola de Matemática Aplicada (EMAp)](https://emap.fgv.br/) at the [Fundação Getúlio Vargas (FGV)](https://portal.fgv.br/) in **Urban Perception**, **Deep Learning**, and **Interpretability Machine Learning**. Current Professional Fellow at [The Royal Academy of Engineering (RAEng)](https://www.raeng.org.uk/), London, UK since 2018.

I am doing a M.Sc. in Computer Science from the [Centro de Investigación e Innovación en Ciencia de la Computación (RICS)](http://rics.ucsp.edu.pe/) in the [Programa de Maestría en Ciencia de la Computación](http://rics.ucsp.edu.pe/mcs/index.html) at the [Universidad Católica San Pablo (UCSP)](http://ucsp.edu.pe/) with the CONCYTEC scholarship, Arequipa, PERU (2018-2020), and a B.Sc. in Computer Science from the [Facultad de Ciencias (FC)](https://fc.uni.edu.pe/fc/) in the [Escuela Profesional de Ciencia de la Computación (EPCC)](https://fc.uni.edu.pe/fc/index.php/escuelas/ciencia-de-la-computacion) at the [Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería (UNI)](https://www.uni.edu.pe/), Lima, PERU (2012-2017).

Furthermore, I have worked as Research Assistant in the [Big Data & HPC Lab](https://www.ctic.uni.edu.pe/index.php/laboratorios/bigdata-hpc) at the [Centro de Tecnologías y Comunicaciones (CTIC)](https://www.ctic.uni.edu.pe/) in fields like **Big Data**, **High-Performance Computing**, and **Fog Computing**. Also, as a part of my professional life, I have worked in [CERNICALO S.A.](http://cernicalo.net/) as a Web Development Engineer in 2017 and [ARIOT S.A.C.](https://ariot.pe/) as Software Engineer in 2018.

## What is Computer Science?

Computer science is a discipline that spans theory and practice based on mathematics and physics. Computer scientists must be experienced in modeling and analyzing problems. With Computer Science, you can create anything and do anything :D.
